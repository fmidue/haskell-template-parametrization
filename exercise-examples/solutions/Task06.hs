-- You may (or may not) also want to prettify the moon itself, by
-- using some other CodeWorld primitives to draw it rather than with
-- our simple calls to 'curve'.

-- Do not try to "cheat" by letting sun or moon continue to move under
-- the ground but hiding them behind an artificially placed rectangle
-- or anything similar.
