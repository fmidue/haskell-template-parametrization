-- Recall the visualization of game levels from #{otherTask}. This time we
-- want to do essentially the same, but use algebraic data types and
-- avoid list comprehensions.

-- A level is now a function from integer pairs to 'Maybe Tile', where
-- 'Nothing' corresponds to no tile being present at that coordinate
-- position (similarly to how we used 0 before).
--
-- In what follows, we use:

data Tile = Block | Water | Pearl | Air

-- as well as the following type synonym for levels, to make type
-- signatures more informative:

type Level = (Integer, Integer) -> Maybe Tile

-- For the compiler there is now no difference whether you write
-- 'Level' or '(Integer, Integer) -> Maybe Tile' somewhere, but it
-- lets us express intended concepts more clearly. In particular, the
-- type of a concrete level can now alternatively be given as
--
--   level :: (Integer, Integer) -> Maybe Tile
--
-- or simply as follows:

level :: Level
level (x, y)
  | abs x > 6 || abs y > 5             = Nothing
  | abs x == 6 || abs y == 5           = Just Block
  | y < 1 && x >= y && abs (x - 2) > 2 = Just Block
  | y < -1                             = Just Water
  | abs y > 2 && abs (x + y - 1) > 5   = Just Pearl
  | x < -4 && y < 2                    = Just Pearl
  | otherwise                          = Just Air

-- Replace 'undefined' above by an actual level in the new, Tile-based
-- encoding. You can either use one of the levels from earlier tasks,
-- or still surprise us with a completly new level of your own making.

-- As before, specific pictures for the different tiles are given:

block, water, pearl, air :: Picture

block = colored (light grey) (solidRectangle 1 1)

water = colored blue (solidRectangle 1 1)

pearl = colored purple (solidCircle 0.3) & air

air = colored (translucent blue) (solidRectangle 1 1)

-- The aTile-function has to be adapted to work on the new data type.

aTile :: Tile -> Picture
aTile Block = block
aTile Water = water
aTile Pearl = pearl
aTile Air = air

-- Now in order to draw a level in the coordinate range [-10..10] on
-- both dimensions, we want you to implement the (higher-order)
-- function 'visualize', under the following constraints:
--
-- Do not use list comprehensions or recursion. Range expressions
-- like [a .. b] are still allowed.
--
-- (Do also not use do-notation in the list monad, if you happen to
-- know that concept.)

visualize :: Level -> Picture
visualize lev = pictures (concatMap (\x -> map (\y -> drawTile (x,y)) [-10..10]) [-10..10])
  where drawTile (x,y) = translated (fromIntegral x) (fromIntegral y) (drawMaybeTile (lev (x,y)))
        drawMaybeTile mt = if isJust mt then aTile (fromJust mt) else blank

visualize' :: Level -> Picture
visualize' lev = pictures (map (\x -> pictures (map (\y -> drawTile (x,y)) [-10..10])) [-10..10])
  where drawTile (x,y) = translated (fromIntegral x) (fromIntegral y) (drawMaybeTile (lev (x,y)))
        drawMaybeTile = maybe blank aTile

-- Hint: see #{maybeDocs}
-- for some functions dealing with 'Maybe' values.
